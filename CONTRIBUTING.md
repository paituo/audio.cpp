# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve audio.cpp. The project is growing quickly, so the most useful contributions are the ones that make the existing model surface easier to use, serve, compose, test, and maintain.

## Preferred Contribution Areas

High-impact areas right now:

- UI and app-facing workflows
- API server behavior, especially OpenAI-compatible serving
- Pipeline and workflow subsystem improvements
- Community model ports
- Extending existing model families with additional variants
- Model documentation, examples, and validation reports
- Cross-platform build and packaging polish

> [!TIP]
> **High-impact optimization work:** as the framework evolves, newer models often gain better performance and memory-management patterns that older integrations have not yet adopted. Backporting those patterns is very useful, but it must be done model by model with careful regression tests for output quality, performance, and memory use.

These areas either improve shared surfaces used by many model families or make existing model support more complete. For already-supported model families, please add new variants to the existing implementation instead of creating a duplicate port.

## Pull Request Requirements

Keep PRs focused. A model port, a server change, a pipeline change, and a broad refactor are easier to review and validate when they are separate.

If a model port needs framework or runtime changes, split them when possible:

- Additive framework/runtime support can be included if it is clearly scoped, opt-in, and genuinely reusable by other models. Do not promote model-specific logic into the framework just because it is convenient; prefer a model-local implementation unless the shared abstraction is clearly useful beyond one model.
- Non-additive framework/runtime behavior changes should be a separate PR before the model port depends on them.
- Backend or GGML changes should be separate PRs so regressions (if any) are easier to trace.

If a PR changes runtime behavior, model implementation, backend logic, performance paths, or shared framework code, include actual runtime validation. Code inspection, generated tests, or "this should work" are not enough by themselves.

For optimization PRs, include before/after measurements. For behavior changes, explain whether outputs, performance, memory, or only docs/build wiring are affected, and include regression checks for the affected route.

**Please keep no more than 3 PRs open at the same time, including draft PRs.**

## Before Adding a Model

Please check the supported model table in [README.md](README.md), the community model docs, and open PRs/issues before starting a new model port. Many requests are better handled by extending an existing family with a new variant, route, GGUF package, backend fix, or UI surface.

If the model family is already listed, build on the existing implementation instead of opening a duplicate port. Add the new variant to the same family/spec/package layout unless there is a real architecture or task boundary that requires a separate family.

For new or updated model packages, keep the loader, model spec, docs, and UI/model-manager package entries aligned. Add or update the family's row in [docs/model_licenses.md](docs/model_licenses.md) too. A package should not advertise a model that the CLI/server cannot actually load, and a spec should not claim options or routes the implementation does not support.

Good follow-up work for existing model families includes:

- Better CLI or server examples
- More complete path tests
- Clearer model-manager package entries
- Additional GGUF variants or model-size variants
- Backend coverage improvements
- Memory, latency, or portability improvements
- Documentation for real user workflows

## New Model PRs

New standalone model ports should normally start under `community_models/`. This keeps ownership clear and lets useful model ports land with a lighter review bar than core framework models. Models can graduate into the core model tree later after they are validated, polished, and maintained as part of the main release surface.

Please read [Welcoming Community Models & Using Model Spec v1 for New Models](https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp/issues/54) before starting a new model PR.

New models should use model spec v1, follow existing model/package naming conventions, and reuse framework modules, runtimes, helpers, and ownership patterns when they fit. 

Even for community models, PRs should include enough evidence for maintainers and users to understand exactly what was tested. Follow the validation style shown in [PR #19](https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp/pull/19) and [PR #63](https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp/pull/63).

Please include:

- Exact build commands
- Exact run commands
- Model paths or model-manager package ids
- Generated output artifacts or paths
- Path-test or parity-test results
- Backend tested, such as CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, or Metal
- Relevant timing, RTF, RSS, VRAM, or resident-memory notes
- Known limitations

For TTS-style community models, the most useful validation includes a long-lived session with multiple requests, a long-form request through the framework text chunker, cache/graph reuse logs when relevant, and peak VRAM under repeated requests. These measurements do not need to be perfect on the first PR, but they make review much faster and help avoid a large cleanup pass after merge.

For models with Python references, include parity evidence when practical. For models without a clean reference path, include reproducible generated outputs and enough setup detail for another contributor to repeat the run.

Please be prepared to help maintain new model contributions as framework APIs evolve. Keeping model code aligned with the shared framework surface is part of making the implementation useful long term.

## Framework Modules (High Risk)

Framework modules are a high-impact but higher-risk contribution area because the internal framework APIs are still evolving quickly. Changes here can affect many model families at once, so please prefer additive work over modifying behavior that existing models already depend on.

If your contribution is a variant of an existing module, add it as a separate experimental module, for example `xxxExp`, instead of branching inside or rewriting the existing module. The new module can replace the existing one later, after it has shown no regressions across all models that rely on the current implementation.
