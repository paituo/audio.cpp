# VibeVoice ASR Models

audio.cpp supports two VibeVoice ASR families:

| Model | Family | Mode(s) | Recommended package |
|---|---|---|---|
| VibeVoice ASR | `vibevoice_asr` | offline | `vibevoice_asr_q8_0` |
| VibeVoice ASR Streaming 7B | `vibevoice_asr_streaming` | offline, streaming | `vibevoice_asr_streaming_7b_q8_0` |
| VibeVoice ASR Streaming 1.5B | `vibevoice_asr_streaming` | offline, streaming | `vibevoice_asr_streaming_1_5b_q8_0` |

## VibeVoice ASR

VibeVoice ASR is an offline ASR model with greedy, sampling, and beam-search
decode paths. It can return transcription text and structured segment or
speaker-turn output when the model produces timestamps.

A fully quantized port of the same model — INT8 activations through the encoder,
ternary BitNet weights in the decoder — lives under community models as
`vibeasr`: see [VibeASR](../community_models/vibeasr.md). It is not a separate
model, only a CPU-only alternative numeric pipeline for the same weights.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Family | `vibevoice_asr` |
| Model directory | `models/VibeVoice-ASR-GGUF` |
| Task | `asr` |
| Modes | `offline` |
| Required tokenizer files | Embedded in the standalone GGUF |
| Output | Transcription text; optional segments through `--segments-out`; optional speaker turns through `--turns-out` |
| Streaming | Not supported |
| Timestamps | Segment and speaker-turn timestamps when produced |

Install:

```bash
python3 tools/model_manager_v2.py install vibevoice_asr_q8_0
```

Offline CLI:

```bash
audiocpp_cli --task asr \
  --family vibevoice_asr \
  --model models/VibeVoice-ASR-GGUF/vibevoice-asr-q8_0.gguf \
  --backend cuda \
  --audio assets/resources/sample_16k.wav \
  --text-out transcript.txt \
  --metrics \
  --log
```

Structured output:

```bash
audiocpp_cli --task asr \
  --family vibevoice_asr \
  --model models/VibeVoice-ASR-GGUF/vibevoice-asr-q8_0.gguf \
  --backend cuda \
  --audio meeting.wav \
  --text "The recording is a meeting conversation." \
  --text-out transcript.txt \
  --segments-out segments.json \
  --turns-out turns.json \
  --metrics \
  --log
```

With VAD chunking, provide the bundled Silero VAD model:

```bash
audiocpp_cli --task asr \
  --family vibevoice_asr \
  --model models/VibeVoice-ASR-GGUF/vibevoice-asr-q8_0.gguf \
  --backend cuda \
  --audio assets/resources/sample_16k.wav \
  --audio-chunk-mode vad \
  --session-option vibevoice_asr.vad_model_path=assets/framework/models/silero_vad \
  --text-out transcript.txt \
  --metrics \
  --log
```

Convert from safetensors:

```powershell
audiocpp_gguf.exe --input models\VibeVoice-ASR\model.safetensors.index.json --output models\VibeVoice-ASR-Q8_0\model.gguf --type q8_0
```

Configuration and tokenizer assets are embedded by default, so the output
directory may contain only `model.gguf`.

## VibeVoice ASR Streaming 7B

VibeVoice ASR Streaming 7B is the streaming VibeVoice ASR model. It keeps a
persistent decoder state and can emit speaker-attributed transcript deltas as
audio arrives. It can also run in offline mode through the same family.

The upstream streaming model emits speaker-attributed text such as
`Speaker 0: ...`, but it does not emit timestamped segments. In audio.cpp,
`--turns-out` can expose those speaker/text turns when the model emits speaker
labels; `--segments-out` is not populated by this streaming model. Use the
non-streaming `vibevoice_asr` family when timestamped segment output is needed.

> [!WARNING]
> Speaker-turn segmentation can differ from the offline VibeVoice ASR family.
> In local validation, the streaming 7B model merged adjacent speech into fewer
> speaker turns than the offline model; the same behavior was reproduced with
> the official Python streaming reference.

The recommended audio.cpp package is the Q8_0 GGUF in the dedicated model repo:
<https://huggingface.co/audio-cpp/VibeVoice-ASR-Streaming-7B-GGUF>. BF16 and
Q4_K GGUF variants are also available in the same repo.

Upstream lists ten supported language codes for this streaming model: `en`,
`zh`, `es`, `pt`, `de`, `ja`, `ko`, `fr`, `ru`, and `it`.

| Task | `asr` |
| Modes | `offline`, `streaming` |
| Required tokenizer files | Embedded in the standalone GGUF |
| Output | Transcript text; speaker/text turns when produced by the model |
| Timestamps | Not produced by the streaming model |
| Streaming | Live audio chunks over the `/v1/audio/transcriptions/live` endpoint |

```

### Common Options (use directly)

| Option | Values | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `--language` | language label | `auto` | ASR language label. |
| `--max-tokens` | integer | `256` | Maximum generated transcript tokens per chunk. |

| `--audio-chunk-seconds` | float seconds | `1200` | Offline chunk duration for fixed and VAD chunking. |

### Request Options (use with `--request-option`)

| Option | Values | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `context` | text | empty string | Extra context or hotwords injected into the streaming prompt. |

### Session Options (use with `--session-option`)

| Option | Values | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `vibevoice_asr_streaming.max_history_steps` | integer | `0` (uncapped) | Rolling window for decoder history, in steps. Refer to [Long streams](#long-streams-and-the-history-window). |

### Long streams and the history window

By default, the decoder stores the full conversation history. Memory use
increases with stream length (approximately 0.4 MiB per step on Q8/CUDA).
On very long streams, the GPU memory becomes full and transcription stops.

Set `max_history_steps` to prevent this. The model then stores only the
most recent steps. Memory use remains constant for streams of any length.

```bash
audiocpp_cli --task asr --family vibevoice_asr_streaming \
  --model models/VibeVoice-ASR-Streaming-7B-GGUF/vibevoice-asr-streaming-7b-q8_0.gguf \
  --backend cuda --mode streaming --audio - --input-format s16le \
  --session-option vibevoice_asr_streaming.max_history_steps=4096
```

The model always stores the streaming prompt. It never removes the prompt.
New steps replace the oldest stored steps, but not the prompt.

Each step is approximately one audio frame or one generated word part.
Speech contains approximately ten steps per second. Thus `4096` stores
approximately ten minutes of speech. At `4096` on Q8/CUDA, total memory
use is stable at approximately 10.0 GB. Larger windows use more memory.
The value must not exceed the model position capacity (131072 for the 7B
model). The program rejects larger values at startup.

Note: A window changes the transcription when compared to full history
because removed context is not available. The window size also causes very
small differences in results because the model calculates in a different
sequence. For reproducible results, do not change the binary or the window
size.

## VibeVoice ASR Streaming 1.5B

The 1.5B checkpoint is the smaller sibling of the streaming 7B and runs through
the **same loader with no code changes**: the layer count, hidden size, and head
counts are all read from the checkpoint's own `config.json`, and the tensor names
are identical. It is a drop-in smaller package, not a separate family.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Family | `vibevoice_asr_streaming` |
| Model package | `vibevoice_asr_streaming_1_5b_q8_0` |
| Model directory | `models/VibeVoice-ASR-Streaming-1.5B-GGUF` |
| GGUF repo | <https://huggingface.co/christopherthompson81/VibeVoice-ASR-Streaming-1.5B-GGUF> |
| Upstream weights | <https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR-Streaming-1.5B> |
| Task, modes, output, timestamps | As the streaming 7B above |

Sizes, and word error rate on the four LibriSpeech clips in
`assets/asr_validation/librispeech/`, greedy decode:

| Package | GGUF size | WER (CUDA) | WER (CPU) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `vibevoice_asr_streaming_7b_q4_k` | 5.86 GB | 4.35% | 4.35% |
| `vibevoice_asr_streaming_1_5b_bf16` | 5.64 GB | 4.35% | 4.35% |
| `vibevoice_asr_streaming_1_5b_q8_0` | 3.34 GB | 5.80% | 4.35% |
| `vibevoice_asr_streaming_1_5b_q4_k` | 2.12 GB | 7.25% | 5.80% |

> [!NOTE]
> **A WER number for a quantized package is only meaningful with its backend.**
> CPU and CUDA quantize activations differently in upstream ggml — Q4_K weights
> meet `Q8_K` activations on CPU (one scale per 256) and `Q8_1` on CUDA (scale
> and sum per 32), and Q8_0 weights meet `Q8_0` against `Q8_1`. The two backends
> therefore differ slightly but deterministically on every quantized matmul.
> BF16 quantizes no activations, which is why its two columns agree exactly.
>
> On these clips the whole effect is one fragile word, where CPU hears the
> correct "cutter" and CUDA hears "country". This is expected upstream behavior,
> not an audio.cpp defect. The 7B not flipping here is four clips, not immunity.

> [!WARNING]
> Four clips is 69 words. One substitution moves the number by 1.4 points, so
> these separate "works and is in the right class" from "broken" and nothing
> finer. The like-for-like pair is the two `q4_k` rows: at equal quantization the
> 7B is ahead on both backends. Do not read the tie between 7B Q4_K and 1.5B BF16
> as parity -- different clips happen to sum to the same total.

```bash
python3 tools/model_manager_v2.py install vibevoice_asr_streaming_1_5b_q8_0
```

Offline CLI, identical to the 7B apart from the model path:

  --family vibevoice_asr_streaming \
  --model models/VibeVoice-ASR-Streaming-1.5B-GGUF/vibevoice-asr-streaming-1.5b-q8_0.gguf \
  --backend cuda \
  --threads 8 \
  --audio assets/resources/sample_16k.wav \
  --text-out transcript.txt \
  --turns-out speaker_turns.json \
  --metrics \
  --log
```

Convert from safetensors:

```bash
audiocpp_gguf --input model.safetensors.index.json \
              --output vibevoice-asr-streaming-1.5b-q8_0.gguf \
              --type q8_0 --family vibevoice_asr_streaming --root sidecars
```

### The padded vocabulary differs, and that is fine

`embed_tokens` is `(151936, 1536)` here against `(152064, 3584)` in the 7B: the
7B's vocabulary row count is padded, the 1.5B's is not. Nothing breaks, because
the shape is validated against the `vocab_size` in the same checkpoint's config.
It would only matter to code that treats the 7B's padded count as a constant --
a shared tokenizer bundle, or a logits slice sized for the 7B -- so keep that in
mind when adding anything that spans both sizes.
